# TGH-Liver-Transplantation
### Using patients data, machine learning algorithms are used to predict patient mortality while they wait for liver transplants.
### Logistic regression, decision tree, random forest models are used and compared their results.

### In addition, An optimized prediction of mortality (OPOM) was proposed by Bertsimas et al. for the same purpose [1]. Data collected in Canadian hospitals is used to validate their OPOM model.
